# Employee-and-Bus-Stops
# Describe Problem : 
The company XYZ is asking you to come up with the **10 most efficient bus stops** that would best serve its employees. Generally speaking, these "efficient" stops would result in the least walking distances between the employees' homes and their respective bus stops.
# Data source : 
- the list of bus stops provided by the city of San Francisco, `Bus_Stops.csv`
- a list of its employees' home addresses, `Employee_Addresses.csv`
# My solution :
- Create baseline Model using distances between employees and bus stations.
- Evaluate baseline Model Using the average walking distance per employee to their respective stops.
- Use more than cluater model to improve the results of baseline Model and evaluate them.
